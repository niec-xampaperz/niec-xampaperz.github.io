              to pursue their interests, learn new skills.If you have the zeal then go for it yourself.
               You have to find your way . some teachers will help you and senior
               also are helpful here.. NIEC has a nice campus life where students
               can take part in a wide range of activities,be it drama , dance , sports or technical.
               but this can seems to be can only from years because of administration.. It really depends on you actually ! How you
               make use of your college time ! You'll meet all sorts of people round
                here ! There are those who barely attend college...those who just sit
                 in canteen....some who are found only in class....so its all down to you
                  ...the kind of people you interact and make friends with ! As for studies
                  there is an unsaid rule ....start studying the day before the exam and you ll
                  ace it smoothly ! (Very helpful in short term as tackles exam well but in long
                   run its disastrous attitude) ! Finally hard work is over rated here so
                    dont be surprised to find people who are big on why do you study talks !
<br><br>Good luck and do manage yourself efficiently ! If you manage well college can be damn good fun !
